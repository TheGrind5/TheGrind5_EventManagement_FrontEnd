## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Why MUI (Not Tailwind)?
- Project already uses Material-UI extensively
- Adding Tailwind would create CSS conflicts
- MUI's `sx` prop provides utility-like styling
- Team familiarity with MUI ecosystem
- Smaller bundle size without dual CSS systems

### Component Extraction Strategy
- Extracted event cards for reusability
- Created category tabs for better UX
- Added footer for completeness
- Kept existing component structure where possible

### Responsive Approach
- Mobile-first design principles
- Breakpoint-specific styling with MUI `sx`
- Tested at 390px, 768px, 1440px viewports
- Ensured touch targets meet accessibility standards
